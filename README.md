# BetaFPV Air65 FPV Drone Settings & Firmware

This repository contains the latest firmware configuration files, and ESC settings for my **Air65 FPV drone**.
It serves as a personal backup and reference for flashing, tuning, and restoring the quad.
It's for the **Racing** Version (***27kKV***), but should work on all other KVs.
***Stock/Defaults/Factory*** settings included.
